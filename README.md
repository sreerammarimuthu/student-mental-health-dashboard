# MindMap: Student Mental Health Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built using the data from the **Healthy Minds Study (2014â€“2024)** to explore mental health patterns among U.S. college students.

This project visualizes trends specifically in:
- Depression (PHQ-9), Anxiety (GAD-7), ADHD, Loneliness, Eating Disorders (SCOFF), and Satisfaction
- Across institution types, sizes, and geographic regions
- Demographics like age, gender, race, and sexual orientation

### Goal: Make large-scale mental health data accessible and actionable for researchers, educators, and policymakers.

A personal passion project combining my interest in behavioral and cognitive analytics â€” built with HTML, Plotly, and data from the University of Michigan's HMS dataset with over 100k records.
